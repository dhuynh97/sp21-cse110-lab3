			<h2>Diary Entry Day 1~</h2>
			<h3>April 5th, 2021 </h3>
			<h4>Dear Diary,</h4>
			<p>Wednesday was cross country. Soo much fun. I was walking with the year 12s. And we walked. 
				<br>The whole way - on the guys 5km track. It was funny and fun. 
				<br>I was tryna push Tom* in a puddle and he was tryin to get me. 
				<br>Nd then we got back to the oval. Ms Bramwell was like really mad. She told the Year 12s they were supposed to be back ages ago 
				<br>nd yelled at us for doing the 5km track and for walking. Then she said something to me 
				<br>"...and you walked with them to be with, I do believe, an ex-boyfriend."
				<br> OMG. She can't tell me why I walked with them. Tom thought it was funny.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>i suck at running!!</li>
				<li>Mr. Herning is mean!!!!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Overall summary:</p>

			<h2>Diary Entry Day 3~</h2>
			<h3>April 7th, 2021 </h3>
			<h4>Dear Diary,</h4>
			<p>Today was so DUM!!! Lol =P how I almost missed the bus Friday. 
				<br>The bell went and I walked to my locker tryna find a stupid note.
				<br> I ran out and tried to hand it in at the office then I ran and saw 
				<br>my bus was driving away!!! Ahhh! I was so scared and stressed.
				<br> LOL. I didn't cry. I went to the other side to see if I could catch 
				<br>it but it wasn't there. I crossed the road as six buses drove past. 
				<br>LOL. Waved down the wrong bus. OMG woops. Then I saw Em! 
				<br>LOL. It was embarassing when I got back on the bus. It waited for me. 
				<br>Embarrassing, thrilling, exciting, scary. Relief!!!</p>
